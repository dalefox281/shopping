# shopping
Brainstorming an application to automate grocery shopping.

Desired functionality;

Create a sort of 'staples' list to add to the 'check' file.

Input dinner name and automatically add all ingredients to a 'check' file.

'Check' file will let you go over every item on your grocery list in a review
style function to make sure that you need it on your list and don't buy extra.

After completed grocery list setup a choice to either;

    1. Create a shopping strategy which will list items by aisle in the store 
starting from produce to bread on the left side of the store.

    2. Maybe input the desired items into the website.

    (No matter which one a checklist style interface might be good for the 
    actual shopping.)
